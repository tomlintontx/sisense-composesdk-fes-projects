# FES ComposeSDK Projects
Welcome! This repo contains projects utilizing the composeSDK. The FES team will work on these projects on a quarterly basis with the goal of increasing our knowledge on the ComposeSDK as well as React/Vue/Angular.

## Instructions
These projects will build on their predecessors over time. It's important to start from `1 - Q1 2024`. 

> The prerequisite for all projects is to complete the SisenseU training titles `ComposeSDK - Getting Started`. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to any of your colleagues or managers. Good luck!
