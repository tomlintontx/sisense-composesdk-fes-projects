# Q1 2024 ComposeSDK Project
This project is a continuation of the `Sisense Compose SDK: Getting Started` project found in SisenseU. In that project, you were asked to output a chart rendered using the `BarChart` function. Once done, it asked you to create a widget using the `ExecuteQuery` function. For this project, your goal is to make the below changes to your application. Once done, you will demo it to your manager where he/she will ask you some follow up questions about the ComposeSDK. Good luck!

1. Create a total of three charts of different types. If you only have one, because you overwrote the first one with the `ExecuteQuery` example, you will need to create 2 more.
2. Generate a date filter and a member filter in the UI and ensure it filters all three charts.
3. Format the numbers on one of your charts to be currency with dollar symbols.
4. Use an existing widget and implement the drilldown functionality. Remember that you need to ensure the filters from the panel still apply to your drilldown widget.

> [!WARNING]
> **Please review with your manager when completed. Be prepared to answer questions on the SDK!**

Congratulations! You have created quite a ComposeSDK application. We have only touched on some of the most basic functionality that our customers have asked for. I highly suggest to continue on with this project as you learn new things and hear about new use cases from our customers. This can be used as a tool to help explain how our SDK works.
